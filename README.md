# Threads-and-Buffers
This project was developed as an assignment for my Fundamentals of Computer Operating Systems class at my university. This was a solo project, and all source code used in the project is either supplied by the university or written by myself.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of shared resources in computer operating systems using bounded buffers and threads. The project takes a look at a problem called the Producer-Consumer problem. The idea is to produce a program that would have two objects, a Producer and a Consumer, that share a data structure and perform operations on it. Producers put items into the data structure and consumers take items out of it.
